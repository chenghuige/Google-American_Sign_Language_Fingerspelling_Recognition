## How to contribute to OpenSpeech?

Everyone is welcome to contribute, and we value everybody's contribution. Code is thus not the only way to help the community. Answering questions, helping others, reaching out and improving the documentations are immensely valuable to the community.

It also helps us if you spread the word: reference the library from blog posts on the awesome projects it made possible, shout out on Twitter every time it has helped you, or simply star the repo to say "thank you".

We will also record all contributors and contributions [here](https://github.com/sooftware/OpenSpeech/blob/main/CONTRIBUTORS.md).

### You can contribute in so many ways!

There are 5 ways you can contribute to OpenSpeech:

- Add new dataset recipe.
- Implementing new models.
- Share the weight file you trained.
- Fixing outstanding issues with the existing code.
- Submitting issues related to bugs or desired new features.

### Do you want to add a new dataset recipe?

Grreat!! Please provide the following information:

- Short description of the dataset and link to the paper.
- Indicate the license of the dataset.
- Write a test code to prove that the code works well.

We want to cover as many datasets as possible. Help us!

### Do you want to implement a new model?

Awesome! Please provide the following information:

- Short description of the model and link to the paper.
- Link to the implementation if it is open-source.
- Link to the model weights if they are available.
- Please write a test code to prove that the code works well.

If you are willing to contribute the model yourself, let us know so we can best guide you.

### Do you want to share the weight file?

Nice, Nice, So Nice!! Because OpenSpeech supports multiple datasets and many models, such contribution is essential.
Please provide the following information:

- Indicate which dataset and which model you trained.
- Share the script you used when you started training.
- Please share the link that can download the weight file.

#### Did you find a bug?

First, we would really appreciate it if you could **make sure the bug was not already reported** (use the search bar on Github under Issues).

Did not find it? :( So we can act quickly on it, please follow these steps:

- Include your OS type and version, the versions of Python, PyTorch when applicable
- Give to us a simple example of a code that we can reproduce.
- Provide the full traceback if an exception is raised.

### Do you want a new feature (that is not a model)?

A world-class feature request addresses the following points:

1. Motivation first:
    - Is it related to a problem/frustration with the library? If so, please explain why. Providing a code snippet that demonstrates the problem is best.
    - Is it related to something you would need for a project? We'd love to hear about it!
    - Is it something you worked on and think could benefit the community? Awesome! Tell us what problem it solved for you.
2. Write a full paragraph describing the feature.
3. Provide a code snippet that demonstrates its future use.
4. In case this is related to a paper, please attach a link.
5. Attach any additional information (drawings, screenshots, etc.) you think may help.

If your issue is well written we're already 80% of the way there by the time you post it.


### Submitting a new issue or feature request

Do your best to follow these guidelines when submitting an issue or a feature request. It will make it easier for us to come back to you quickly and with good feedback.
Also, I want you to write in English when you write an issue or pull request. Because we hope as many people as possible can understand and see the issue or pull request.
