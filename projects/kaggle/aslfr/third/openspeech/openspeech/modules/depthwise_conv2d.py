class DepthwiseConv2d(BaseConv2d):
    r"""
    When groups == in_channels and out_channels == K * in_channels, where K is a positive integer,
    this operation is termed in literature as depthwise convolution.
    ref : https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Conv2d.html

    Args:
        in_channels (int): Number of channels in the input
        out_channels (int): Number of channels produced by the convolution
        kernel_size (int or tuple): Size of the convolving kernel
        stride (int, optional): Stride of the convolution. Default: 2
        padding (int or tuple, optional): Zero-padding added to both sides of the input. Default: 0

    Inputs: inputs
        - **inputs** (batch, in_channels, time, dim): Tensor containing input vector

    Returns: outputs
        - **outputs** (batch, out_channels, time, dim): Tensor produces by depthwise 2-D convolution.
