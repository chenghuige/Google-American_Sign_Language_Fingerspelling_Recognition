## Supported Datasets

We supports [LibriSpeech](https://www.openslr.org/12), [KsponSpeech](https://aihub.or.kr/aidata/105), and [AISHELL-1](https://www.openslr.org/33/).

LibriSpeech is a corpus of approximately 1000 hours of 16kHz read English speech, prepared by Vassil Panayotov with the assistance of Daniel Povey. The data is derived from read audiobooks from the LibriVox project, and has been carefully segmented and aligned.

KsponSpeech is a large-scale spontaneous speech corpus of Korean. This corpus contains 969 h of general open-domain dialog utterances, spoken by about 2000 native Korean speakers in a clean environment. All data were constructed by recording the dialogue of two people freely conversing on a variety of topics and manually transcribing the utterances. To start training, the KsponSpeech dataset must be prepared in advance. To download KsponSpeech, you needs permission from [AI Hub](https://aihub.or.kr/).

Aishell is an open-source Chinese Mandarin speech corpus published by Beijing Shell Shell Technology Co.,Ltd. 400 people from different accent areas in China are invited to participate in the recording, which is conducted in a quiet indoor environment using high fidelity microphone and downsampled to 16kHz.
