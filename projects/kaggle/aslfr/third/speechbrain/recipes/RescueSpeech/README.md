# Noise robust speech recognition on RescueSpeech dataset
[RescuSpeech](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8077622) is a dataset specifically designed for performing noise robust speech recognition in the Search and Rescue domain. In this repository, we provide training recipes and pre-trained models for the best setup that have been developed and evaluated using RescuSpeech data. This aims to enhance the performance of speech recognizers in challenging and noisy environments.

Our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04054) compares ASR models (CRDNN, Wav2vec2, WavLM, Whisper) and speech-enhancement systems (SepFormer). This recipe contains the best-performing model, which is based on a simple combination of a speech enhancement model (**SepFormer**) and an ASR (**Whisper**) model. The models are trained jointly and then combined to tackle noise interference.

## Installing Extra Dependencies

Before proceeding, ensure you have installed the necessary additional dependencies. To do this, simply run the following command in your terminal:

```
pip install -r extra_requirements.txt
```

## How to run
```
cd RescueSpeech/ASR/noise-robust
python train.py hparams/robust_asr_16k.yaml --data_folder=<data_folder_path>
```
Here the data path should be the path to **uncompressed `Task_ASR.tar.gz`** downloaded from link above.

# How to run on test sets only
If you want to run it on the test sets only, you can add the flag `--test_only` to the following command:

```shell
cd RescueSpeech/ASR/noise-robust
python train.py hparams/robust_asr_16k.yaml --data_folder=<data_folder_path> --test_only
```
## Computing power
Please note that running this recipe can be computationally demanding due to the Whisper ASR (`whisper-large-v2`) model with 906.5M parameters (compared to 1.5B parameters in the original model but feature encoder is frozen in our case). When fine-tuning both the Whisper and SepFormer models together, we used an Nvidia A100-80 GB GPU, which took approximately 15 minutes per epoch.

## Results
During training, both speech enhancement and ASR is kept unfrozen- i.e. both ASR and ehnance loss are backpropagated and weights are updated.

| Model | SISNRi | SDRi | PESQ   | STOI  | *WER*   |
|------ |--------|-------|-------|-------|----   |
| Whisper (`large-v2`)| 7.334 | 7.871 | 2.085 | 0.857 | **24.20** |


## Fine-tuned models
1. Firstly, the SepFormer enhancement model is trained on the Microsoft-DNS dataset. Subsequently, it undergoes fine-tuning with our RescueSpeech *enhancement* dataset (first row in the table below).
2. The Whisper ASR is fine-tuned on the RescueSpeech *ASR* dataset (second row in the table below).
3. Finally, the fine-tuned SepFormer and Whisper ASR models are jointly fine-tuned using our RescueSpeech *ASR* dataset. This represents the best model reported in the table above, with its pretrained models and logs accessible in the third row of the table below.
