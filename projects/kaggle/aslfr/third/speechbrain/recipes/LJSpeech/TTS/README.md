# Text-to-Speech (with LJSpeech)
This folder contains the recipes for training TTS systems (including vocoders) wiith the popular LJSpeech dataset.

# Dataset
The dataset can be downloaded from here:
https://data.keithito.com/data/speech/LJSpeech-1.1.tar.bz2

## Installing Extra Dependencies

Before proceeding, ensure you have installed the necessary additional dependencies. To do this, simply run the following command in your terminal:

```
pip install -r extra_requirements.txt
```

# Tacotron 2
The subfolder "tacotron2" contains the recipe for training the popular [tacotron2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.05884) TTS model.
To run this recipe, go into the "tacotron2" folder and run:

```
python train.py --device=cuda:0 --max_grad_norm=1.0 --data_folder=/your_folder/LJSpeech-1.1 hparams/train.yaml
```

The training logs are available [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/1npvo1g1ncafipf/AAC5DR1ErF2Q9V4bd1DHqX43a?dl=0).

You can find the pre-trained model with an easy-inference function on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/speechbrain/tts-tacotron2-ljspeech).

# FastSpeech2
The subfolder "fastspeech2" contains the recipe for training the non-autoregressive transformer based TTS model [FastSpeech2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.04558).

Training FastSpeech2 requires pre-extracted phoneme alignments (durations). The LJSpeech phoneme alignments from Montreal Forced Aligner can be automatically downloaded, decompressed and stored at this location: ```/your_folder/LJSpeech-1.1/TextGrid```.

To run this recipe, go into the "fastspeech2" folder and run:

```
pip install -r extra_requirements.txt

python train.py --data_folder=/your_folder/LJSpeech-1.1 hparams/train.yaml
```
Training takes about 3 minutes/epoch on 1 * V100 32G.

The training logs are available [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/tqyp58ogejqfres/AAAtmq7cRoOR3XTsq0iSgyKBa?dl=0).

You can find the pre-trained model with an easy-inference function on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/speechbrain/tts-fastspeech2-ljspeech).

# HiFi GAN (Vocoder)
The subfolder "vocoder/hifi_gan/" contains the [HiFi GAN vocoder](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.05646.pdf).
The vocoder is a neural network that converts a spectrogram into a waveform (it can be used on top of Tacotron 2).

We suggest using `tensorboard_logger` by setting `use_tensorboard: True` in the yaml file, thus `Tensorboard` should be installed.

To run this recipe, go into the "vocoder/hifi_gan/" folder and run:

```
python train.py hparams/train.yaml --data_folder /path/to/LJspeech
```

Training takes about X hours on an nvidia RTX8000.

The training logs are available [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/m2xrdssiroipn8g/AAD-TqPYLrSg6eNxUkcImeg4a?dl=0)

You can find the pre-trained model with an easy-inference function on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/speechbrain/tts-hifigan-ljspeech).
