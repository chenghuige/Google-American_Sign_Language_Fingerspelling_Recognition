# TIMIT ASR with Transducer models.
This folder contains the scripts to train an RNNT system using TIMIT.
TIMIT is a speech dataset available from LDC: https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC93S1


# Extra-Dependencies
This recipe support two implementation of Transducer loss, see `use_torchaudio` arg in Yaml file:
1- Transducer loss from torchaudio (if torchaudio version >= 0.10.0) (Default)
2- Speechbrain Implementation using Numba lib. (this allow you to have a direct access in python to the Transducer loss implementation)
Note: Before running this recipe, make sure numba is installed. Otherwise, run:
```
pip install numba
```

# How to run
Update the path to the dataset in the yaml config file and run the following.
```
python train.py hparams/train.yaml
```

The output folders with checkpoints and logs for TIMIT recipes can be found [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/059jnwdass8v45u/AADTjh5DYdYKuZsgH9HXGx0Sa?dl=0).

# Training Time
About 2 min and 40 sec for each epoch with a  RTX 6000.
