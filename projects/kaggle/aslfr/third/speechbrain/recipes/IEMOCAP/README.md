# Emotion recognition experiments with IEMOCAP (speech only)
This folder contains scripts for running emotion recognition experiments with the IEMOCAP dataset (https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/iemocap).

# Training ECAPA-TDNN/wav2vec 2.0/HuBERT
Run the following command to train the model:
`python train.py hparams/train.yaml`
or with wav2vec2 model:
`python train_with_wav2vec2.py hparams/train_with_wav2vec2.yaml`

# Results
The results reported here use random splits
| Release | hyperparams file | Val. Acc. | Test Acc. | Model link | GPUs |

# Training Time
About 40 sec for each epoch with a TESLA V100 (with ECAPA-TDNN).
About 3min 14 sec for each epoch with a TESLA V100 (with wav2vec2 BASE encoder).

# Note on Data Preparation
We here use only the audio part of the dataset.

Our `iemocap_prepare.py` will:
1. Do labelling transformation to 4 emitions [neural, happy, sad, anger]
2. Prepare IEMOCAP data with random split if different_speakers is False. (Note for becnhmarking: you need to run 5 folds)
3. Prepare IEMOCAP data with speaker-independent split if different_speakers is True. (Note for becnhmarking: you need to run 10 folds with test_spk_id from 1 to 10)
