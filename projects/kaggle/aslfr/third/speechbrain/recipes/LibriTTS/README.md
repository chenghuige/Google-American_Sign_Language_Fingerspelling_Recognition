# Text-to-Speech with LibriTTS
This folder contains the recipes for training TTS systems (including vocoders) with the LibriTTS dataset.

# Dataset
The LibriTTS dataset is available here: https://www.openslr.org/60/, https://www.openslr.org/resources/60/

The `libritts_prepare.py` file automatically downloads the dataset if not present and has facilities to provide the names of the subsets to be downloaded.

# HiFi GAN (Vocoder)
The subfolder "vocoder/hifi_gan/" contains the [HiFi GAN vocoder](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.05646.pdf).
The vocoder is a neural network that converts a spectrogram into a waveform (it can be used on top of Tacotron2).

We suggest using `tensorboard_logger` by setting `use_tensorboard: True` in the yaml file. Thus, `Tensorboard` should be installed.

To run this recipe, go into the `"vocoder/hifigan/"` folder and run:

```
python train.py hparams/train.yaml --data_folder=/path/to/LibriTTS
```

The recipe will automatically download the librispeech dataset and resamples it as specified.

The training logs and checkpoints are available [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/gjs1kslxkxz819q/AABPriN4dOoD1qL7NoIyVk0Oa?dl=0).

To change the sample rate for model training go to the `"vocoder/hifigan/hparams/train.yaml"` file and change the value for `sample_rate` as required.
