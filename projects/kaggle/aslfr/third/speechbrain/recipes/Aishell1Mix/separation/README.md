# Speech separation with Aishell1Mix
This folder contains some popular recipes for the Aishell1Mix dataset similar to [LibriMix Dataset](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.11262.pdf) (2/3 sources).

* This recipe supports train with several source separation models on Aishell1Mix, including [Sepformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.13154), [DPRNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.06379), [ConvTasnet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.07454), [DPTNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.13975).

## Installing Extra Dependencies

Before proceeding, ensure you have installed the necessary additional dependencies. To do this, simply run the following command in your terminal:


Make sure that SoX is installed on your machine.

* For windows :
```
conda install -c groakat sox
```
* For Linux or MacOS:
```
conda install -c conda-forge sox
```
Additional dependencies:
```
pip install -r ../extra-requirements.txt
```

To run it:

```shell
python train.py hparams/sepformer-aishell1mix2.yaml --data_folder /yourdatapath
python train.py hparams/sepformer-aishell1mix3.yaml --data_folder /yourdatapath
```
Note that during training we print the negative SI-SNR (as we treat this value as the loss).

If you want to run it on the test sets only, you can add the flag `--test_only` to the following command:

```shell
python train.py hparams/sepformer-aishell1mix2.yaml --data_folder /yourdatapath --test_only
python train.py hparams/sepformer-aishell1mix3.yaml --data_folder /yourdatapath --test_only
```

# Aishell1Mix2/3
* Your data folder should contain data_aishell (aishell1), resource_aishell (aishell1), wham_noise and aishell1mix, which can be created using the scripts at `https://github.com/huangzj421/Aishell1Mix`. Otherwise train.py will download and prepare data into your data path automatically.


# Dynamic Mixing:

* This recipe supports dynamic mixing where the training data is dynamically created in order to obtain new utterance combinations during training.

# Results

Here are the SI - SNRi results (in dB) on the test set of Aishell1Mix dataset with SepFormer:

| | SepFormer. Aishell1Mix2 |
| --- | --- |
| NoDynamicMixing | 10.9 |
| DynamicMixing | 13.4 |


| | SepFormer. Aishell1Mix3 |
| --- | --- |
| NoDynamicMixing | 8.1 |
| DynamicMixing | 11.2 |

The output folders with model checkpoints and logs is available [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/6x9356yuybj8lue/AABPlpS03Vcci_E3jA69oKoXa?dl=0).

# Example calls for running the training scripts

* Aishell1Mix2 with dynamic mixing `python train.py hparams/sepformer-aishell1mix2.yaml --data_folder /yourdatapath --dynamic_mixing True`

* Aishell1Mix3 with dynamic mixing `python train.py hparams/sepformer-aishell1mix3.yaml --data_folder /yourdatapath --dynamic_mixing True`

* Aishell1Mix2 with dynamic mixing with WHAM! noise in the mixtures `python train.py hparams/sepformer-aishell1mix2-wham.yaml --data_folder /yourdatapath --dynamic_mixing True`

* Aishell1Mix3 with dynamic mixing with WHAM! noise in the mixtures `python train.py hparams/sepformer-aishell1mix3-wham.yaml --data_folder /yourdatapath --dynamic_mixing True`

# Multi-GPU training

You can run the following command to train the model using Distributed Data Parallel (DDP) with 2 GPUs:

```
 python -m torch.distributed.launch --nproc_per_node=2 train.py hparams/sepformer.yaml --data_folder /yourdatapath --distributed_launch --distributed_backend='nccl'
```
You can add the other runtime options as appropriate. For more complete information on multi-GPU usage, take a look at this [tutorial](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/13pBUacPiotw1IvyffvGZ-HrtBr9T6l15).
