# LibriSpeech ASR with Transducer models.
This folder contains scripts necessary to run an ASR experiment with the LibriSpeech dataset;
Before running this recipe, make sure numba is installed (pip install numba)
You can download LibriSpeech at http://www.openslr.org/12

# Extra-Dependencies
This recipe supports two implementations of the transducer loss, see `use_torchaudio` arg in the yaml file:
1. Transducer loss from torchaudio (this requires torchaudio version >= 0.10.0).
2. Speechbrain implementation using Numba. To use it, please set `use_torchaudio=False` in the yaml file. This version is implemented within SpeechBrain and  allows you to directly access the python code of the transducer loss (and directly modify it if needed).

The Numba implementation is currently enabled by default as the `use_torchaudio` option is incompatible with `bfloat16` training.

Note: Before running this recipe, make sure numba is installed. Otherwise, run:
```
pip install numba
```

# How to run it
```shell
python train.py hparams/conformer_transducer.yaml
```

# Librispeech Results

Dev. clean is evaluated with Greedy Decoding while the test sets are using Greedy Decoding OR a RNNLM + Beam Search.
