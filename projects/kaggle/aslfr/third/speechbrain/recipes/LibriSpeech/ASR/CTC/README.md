# LibriSpeech ASR with CTC and pre-trained wav2vec2 or whisper models.
This folder contains the scripts to finetune a wav2vec2 or a whisper based system using LibriSpeech.
You can download LibriSpeech at http://www.openslr.org/12.

**Supported pre-trained wav2vec2:** [SpeechBrain](https://github.com/speechbrain/speechbrain/tree/develop/recipes/LibriSpeech/self-supervised-learning/wav2vec2) and [HuggingFace](https://github.com/speechbrain/speechbrain/tree/develop/recipes/CommonVoice/self-supervised-learning/wav2vec2)

## Installing Extra Dependencies

Before proceeding, ensure you have installed the necessary additional dependencies. To do this, simply run the following command in your terminal:

```
pip install -r extra_requirements.txt
```

# How to run
```
python train_with_wav2vec.py hparams/file.yaml
```
```
python train_with_whisper.py hparams/file.yaml
```
To run a fine-tuning of "WavLM" with signal downsampled inputs (for faster training and inferences)

```
python train_with_wav2vec.py hparams/downsampled/train_hf_wavlm_signal_downsampling.yaml --downsampling_factor 2
```

# KenLM n-gram CTC rescoring
To enable n-gram rescoring during the decoding, you can download the LibriSpeech official LM from [here](https://www.openslr.org/11/). Please make sure to install the extra dependencies first. Any KenLM language model may be used with this rescoring technique. Results are reported without rescoring.

# Downsampling inputs for faster fine-tuning and inferences using SSL Models
This repository contains the code allowing to reproduce part of the results obtained in the paper : "Fine-tuning Strategies for Faster Inference using Speech Self-Supervised Models:  A Comparative Study"
The reported experiments are the ones leading to largest inference time reductions while keeping lower error rates, using a downsampling of the input sequences. You can download LibriSpeech at http://www.openslr.org/12.

### Downsampling Results with Librispeech train-clean-100 split
The inference times shown here are for running the whole test-clean LibriSpeech split, and are in seconds. MACs shown here are the mean MACs for a test batch
These results are obtained using WavLM Large finetuned only on the train-clean-100 split of LibriSpeech (100 hours of speech)
