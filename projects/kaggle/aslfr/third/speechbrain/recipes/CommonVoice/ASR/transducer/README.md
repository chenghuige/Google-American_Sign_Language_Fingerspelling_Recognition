# CommonVoice ASR with Transducers.
This folder contains scripts necessary to run an ASR experiment with the CommonVoice dataset: [CommonVoice Homepage](https://commonvoice.mozilla.org/)

# Extra-Dependencies
This recipe support two implementation of Transducer loss, see `use_torchaudio` arg in Yaml file:
1- Transducer loss from torchaudio (if torchaudio version >= 0.10.0) (Default)
2- Speechbrain Implementation using Numba lib. (this allow you to have a direct access in python to the Transducer loss implementation)
Note: Before running this recipe, make sure numba is installed. Otherwise, run:
```
pip install numba
```

# How to run
python train.py hparams/{hparam_file}.py

# Data preparation
It is important to note that CommonVoice initially offers mp3 audio files at 42Hz. Hence, audio files are downsampled on the fly within the dataio function of the training script.

# Languages
Here is a list of the different languages that we tested within the CommonVoice dataset
with our transducers:
- French
