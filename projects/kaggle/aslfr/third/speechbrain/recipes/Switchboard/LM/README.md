# Language Model with Switchboard
This folder contains recipes for finetuning language models for the Switchboard dataset.
It supports both an RNN-based LM and a Transformer-based LM.

You can download the Switchboard data at https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC97S62.

The eval2000/Hub5 English test set can be found at:
- Speech data: https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2002S09
- Transcripts: https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2002T43

Part 1 and part 2 of the Fisher corpus are available at:
- https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2004T19
- https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2005T19

As in Kaldi's [swbd/s5c](https://github.com/kaldi-asr/kaldi/tree/master/egs/swbd/s5c) recipe,
the Fisher transcripts can be used as an additional resource for training Tokenizer and LM.

# How to run:
```
python train.py hparams/transformer.yaml
python train.py hparams/transformer_finetune.yaml
```
