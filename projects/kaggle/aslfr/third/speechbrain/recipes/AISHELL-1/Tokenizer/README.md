# Tokenizer.
This folder contains the scripts to train a tokenizer using SentencePiece (https://github.com/google/sentencepiece).
The tokenizer is trained on the top of the AISHELL training transcriptions.

# How to run
`python train.py hparams/tokenizer_bpe5000.yaml`

`python train.py hparams/train_transformer_tokenizer_bpe5000.yaml`

The output folder with the tokenizers and logs is available [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/gh1qyf833t7h3op/AADG0y1bGGIL4yufsXtuBgXma?dl=0).
