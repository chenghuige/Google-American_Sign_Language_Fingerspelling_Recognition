# AISHELL-1 ASR with CTC.
This folder contains a CTC-wav2vec2 recipe for speech recognition with [AISHELL-1](https://www.openslr.org/33/), a 150-hour Chinese ASR dataset.

### How to run
1- Tokenizer/Dataset
A pretrained tokenizer from [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/bert-base-chinese) is used and can be downloaded
automatically.

If not present in the specified data_folder, the dataset will be automatically downloaded there.
This step is not mandatory. We will use the official tokenizer downloaded from the web if you do not
specify a different tokenizer in the speech recognition recipe.

2- Train the speech recognizer
```
python train_with_wav2vec.py hparams/train_with_wav2vec.yaml
```

Make sure to have "transformers" installed.

# Training Time
It takes about 2h on 1 RTX 8000 (48GB)

# PreTrained Model + Easy-Inference
You can find the pre-trained model with an easy-inference function on HuggingFace
