If my work is helpful to you, remember to upvote his notebook too.\n","The code is essentially the same. I made some changes and fixed some problems:\n","\n","1. I used two transformer layer in the encoder instead of four.\n","2. I used four attention heads instead of two.\n","3. I used new tokens for SOS, EOS, and padding (very minor since Rohith used rare tokens for these purposes, but still- more 'correct').\n","2. I fixed a bug (probably?) in the decoder's dropout layers, which did not have the training flag, resulting in dropout during inference. This change gave a nice bump in the score.\n","3. I made the passing of the training flag explicit. I know it can be implicit since it is a kwarg, but explicit passing makes the whole thing more straightforward and maybe fix another one or two training-flag-related bugs along the way.\n","4. I changed the positional encoding in the decoder from tf.keras.layers.Embedding to proper positional embeddings (i.e., the usual sines and cosines usually used for this purpose). This had a significant impact.\n","5. I added positional embedding to the encoder. This, too, had a significant impact.\n","\n","The rest should be very similar to Rohith's notebook.\n","\n","\n","I hope this notebook will be a valuable stepping stone for better models.
